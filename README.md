# final-portfolio-collages

I want to expand on the skills I learned in the visual unit by creating two photos through photoshop. The images will be like a collage of images that center around human behavior. While I’m not sure yet what images I’ll be using for this project I want all two colleges to share a common theme while ultimately still being different from one another. The theme will most likely be centered around human interaction with the natural world. While this isn’t necessarily a clear visual argument I do want to bring some attention to environmental and social justice issues today.
